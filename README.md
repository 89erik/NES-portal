NES-portal
====================

This is a simplified implementation of Valve's Portal for the Nintento Entertainment System (NES).

The executable is (.nes) is included in the repository an can be run in a NES emulator. I am using the [CC65 compiler](http://www.cc65.org/index.php) available at ftp://ftp.musoftware.de/pub/uz/cc65/

This repository is built upon my NES-pong project, also available here at github.

To get started, I have been following a guide by Johan Fjeldtvedt, available [here](http://www.diskusjon.no/index.php?showtopic=519922). The guide is in Norwegian.
